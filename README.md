### Project 2
#### Analytical dive on Erik Ten Hag's performance at Manchester United

This project is aimed to see how Manchester United has performed under the new manger Erik Ten Hag and to answer the question, is he the right man for the job?

### Project 3
#### kVp-mA adjuster 

This project looks to create a calculator that automatically adjusts the kVp (kilovolt peak) and mA (milliampere-seconds) for manual radiography techniques. Calibrating kVp and mAs accurately in radiography is crucial for several reasons:

1. Image Quality

    kVp controls the penetration power of the X-rays. Higher kVp produces X-rays with more energy, which can penetrate denser tissues like bones, while lower kVp is useful for imaging softer tissues.
    mAs controls the quantity of X-rays produced, impacting the overall exposure and brightness of the image. Higher mAs results in more X-ray photons and a brighter image.
    Incorrect calibration can lead to underexposed (too dark) or overexposed (too bright) images, reducing the diagnostic utility.

2. Radiation Dose Management

    Accurate calibration of kVp and mAs helps ensure the lowest possible radiation dose is used to achieve a diagnostic image. Overexposure unnecessarily increases radiation dose to the patient, while underexposure might require repeat scans, further increasing exposure.

3. Contrast and Sharpness

    kVp affects the contrast of the image. Lower kVp produces higher contrast (sharper distinction between different tissue types), while higher kVp results in lower contrast. This balance is important for visualizing specific anatomical structures.
    mAs impacts the sharpness of the image by affecting the amount of noise. Low mAs can increase image noise, making it harder to identify fine details.

4. Consistency and Reproducibility

    Proper calibration ensures consistent results across different imaging sessions. This is important for comparing images taken over time (e.g., monitoring the progression of a disease).

5. Equipment Longevity

    Accurately calibrated equipment reduces wear and tear on the X-ray tube and other components, preventing unnecessary stress on the system and prolonging the equipmentâ€™s life
